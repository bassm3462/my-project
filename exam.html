            Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that
            is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.[1]
            It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample
            data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed
            to do so.[2]
